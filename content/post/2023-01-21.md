in general there are two types of people, one of which recognizes that science is hard and he/she lives in a broken academic system academia of "publish or perish", yet sees his/her role in it and chooses to make it better by believing the value of education and that he/she could make impactful contribution, create opportunities for others. The other one being that he/she reckons the harsh realities and throw their hands up and quit. i think neither is good or bad, itâ€™s all about knowing yourself and seeing your role.
