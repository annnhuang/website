as i was preparing to present in the symposium/panel discussion on “social interactions with machines” at the 2022 DGPs congress where we discussed computers as social actors, how/whether interfaces should be anthropomorphized, i came across this article written by rosalind picard in 1998 titled “[human and machine dignity]”. this was a very refreshing read!

the reasoning in this article is simple yet very profound. the author discusses the fact that humans are simply limited in our ability to judge (we are not God, after all), particularly when it comes to defining values and worth. this article was very well written and reminded me the simple beauty of the christian gospel.

> ...with this assumption, humans have dignity not because of their goodness, creativity, intelligence, beauty, contributions, capabilities, or any other human measures of value or worth. Ultimate human worth is the mark of an outside endower of dignity, given to every human. This mark is not earned by us, and not controlled by us. it is given to us for what we are, and not for what we have, do, or produce. it is imprinted upon every human, young and old, healthy and infirm, even theist or atheist.
