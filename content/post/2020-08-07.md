the other day i came across this interesting post about a group of researchers from graz university of technology in austria that has investigated the potential of using “tattoo” electrodes, which was traditionally used to measure ecg (heart rate) by sticking them to the skin surface, to record brain signals. if sucessfully developed, this method for measuring brain activity will replace the conventional, bulky eeg cap and advances the field of neurotechnology. the “tattoo” electrode looks like this:

pretty nuts!

the history of scalp recording began with hans berger, a german psychiatrist who discovered the electrical activity in the human brain and recorded it using eeg in 1924. berger analyzed these brain wave patterns especially in people with brain diseases. then dr. jacques vidal at ucla in the 70s was the first person who coined the term “brain-computer interface” (bci) which essentially makes use of the recorded brain signals for developing useful applications. from then on, the business of bci took root and flourished as this method unlocks possibilities for meeting mankind’s ultimate desire to come up with a machine that communicates with human thoughts to achieve the perfect transhumanism.

### what is bci and how does it work?

a bci is a computer-based system that acquires brain signals, analyzes them, and translates them into commands that are relayed to an output device to carry out a desired action. the applications of bcis are many, but they mainly include replacing and restoring one’s functions that were impaired due to neuromuscular disorders. for example, a bci system can restore a paralyzed individual’s ability to speak by implanting wireless microelectrodes in his brain, thereby providing the person control for an artificial speech synthesizer. in addition, researchers at standford university recently developed a very exciting intracortical bci that can decode imagined handwriting movements from brain activity in the motor cortex and translate that, in real time, into text.

bcis hold immense and promising potential for not only inducing neurorehabilitation (e.g. [thought control of robotic arms]) but also enhancing man’s capability, and the way they work is by identifying, extracting and decoding brain patterns of a mental state, and translating them into useful commands for applications.

there are a couple of eeg-based bci paradigms, including those of reactive and passive. according to [zander and kothe 2011], a reactive bci is one that derives its outputs from brain activity arising in reaction to external stimulation, which is indirectly modulated by the user for controlling an application. a well-known example is the [p300 speller], which is essentially a communication tool that uses one’s thoughts to send commands to a computer. a passive bci is one that derives its outputs from arbitrary brain activity arising without the purpose of voluntary control, for enriching a human-machine interaction with implicit information on the actual user state. basically, it estimates and monitors an individual’s cognitive state. for example, a passive bci system can be used to monitor a pilot’s level of attention or fatigue or a video gamer’s affective state which in turn, reveals one’s level of engagement. these information are valuable for designing adaptive technologies.

### the ambition of neuralink

not surprisingly, [neuralink] has attracted a lot of attention in the media.

the ambition of neuralink is to ultimately come up a way to measure brain activities with ultra-high precision, meaning acquiring signals with quality temporal and spatial resolution with least invasiveness and most bio-compatibleness using emerging tools in engineering and neuroscience. the ultimate purpose is to extract and decode the human brain to build high-performance brain-machine interfaces that can treat people with severe brain diseases. conventional eeg method has been useful for recording electrical activity in different regions of the brain by placing an array of electrodes on one’s scalp; however, it is limited as it provides a very low spatial resolution and the method is bulky. other methods, such as ecog, or multielectrode array which literally place electrodes literally on the surface of the brain (the latter actually inserts needles into the cortex) to acquire brain signals with high temporal resolution, but they are limited because of their invasiveness.

in developing the ultimate technology for reading the mind, neuralink seeks to overcome major hurdles of high bandwidth (number of neurons we can simultaneously record) and implantation (skull-opening surgery). if researchers can solve these challenges and come up with a device that is biocompatible, high-bandwidth, bidirectional communicative and able to be non-invasively implanted, then humans are definitely very near in achieving the ultimate human enhancement.
