i finally picked up and read *the collected schizophrenias* by esmé weijun wang. i’ve thoroughly enjoyed the book! but amount of class knowledge impressed me as much as reading through wang’s open and honest portrayal of what it’s like navigating through everyday life with schizoaffective disorder.

the book is a collection of non-fiction essays that explores what it’s like to live with a chronic illness which often brings stigma and misperceptions from the public. here is a piece by the new yorker about the book. at any rate, i gave this book a five star our of five and highly recommend it to everyone.

## what is schizophrenia?

[schizophrenia (scz)] is a seriously debilitating mental disorder that affects a person’s cognition and behavior. it is usually diagnosed in the late teen years to the early thirties. the positive symptoms of scz include hallucinations (most frequently auditory), delusions, and loss of ability to draw the lines between self and environment. the negative symptoms of scz include lack of motivation, anhedonia (loss of pleasure), social withdrawal, impaired working memory and attention. these symptoms lead to weakened everyday functioning (only 25% pursue a regular job) and bring heavy socioeconomic burden on the society [10 billion €/year in germany].

## the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia

dopamine is a neurotransmitter and hormone that plays an important role in the brain. it is a chemical messenger between neurons and it is released when the brain is expecting a reward or pleasure. **the dopamine theory of schizophrenia is basically a model that attributes these symptoms of schizophrenia to hyperactive dopaminergic signal transduction in one’s brain.** this long-standing theory draws evidence from a large body of pharmacological studies that show antipsychotic drugs mitigate these hyperactivity between the neurotransmitter and its receptor, thus alleviating some disease symptoms.

so, “at what levels must we be able to understand dopaminergic modulation of brain functions in order to develop effective treatments for mental disorders?” in other words, where are we right now, and what is going to be the future of psychiatry in developing effective treatments for psychiatric disorders?
it's important to note here that this is not just for schizophrenia, but other mental illnesses like major depression are similarly subjected to theories postulating that mental disease symptoms are inherently caused by chemical imbalances in the brain.

i think that developing effective treatments for mental disorders will require multiple levels of understanding, not solely at the cellular and molecular level of dopaminergic modulation of brain functions. today the world places a heavy emphasis on developing drugs to treat mental illnesses— so much so that we may inadvertently neglect other factors that influence the lives of these patients. not to even mention the complex interplay between real science and the self-interest of big pharmaceutical companies.

in the book *blaming the brain: the truth about drugs and mental health*, elliot s. valenstein, claims that we may be “blaming the brain” for mental illnesses:

> the evidence and arguments supporting claims about the relationship of brain chemistry to psychological problems and personality and behavioral traits are far from compelling and are most likely wrong. (p. 3.)…the evidence claimed to support the various chemical theories of mental illness is not strong, and there is much evidence that contradicts the prevailing view…the truth is that we still do not know what causes any mental disorder or how drugs sometimes help patients get better. - valenstein, pg.165

though i don’t endorse evreything he wrote in the book, i think there’s still truth to these (somewhat dogmatic though) claims. i think there undoubtedly exists biochemical evidence that give rise to the apparent symptoms of mental disorders; however, the truth about mental illness is that it is a complex mix of biological and environmental factors; therefore, pursuing the cure for these diseases purely from the angle of chemical imbalances in the brain is most likely not enough.

lastly, here are a few of my favorite quotes from the *collected schizophrenias*:

> sick people, as it turns out, generally stray into alternative medicine not because they relish the idea of indulging in what others call quackery, but because traditional western medicine has failed them.

> …a primary feature of the experience of staying in a psychiatric hospital is that you will not be believed about anything. a corollary to this feature: things will be believed about you that are not at all true.

> after all, it is easy to forget that psychiatric diagnoses are human constructs, and not handed down from an all-knowing god on stone tablets; to “have schizophrenia” is to fit an assemblage of symptoms, which are listed in a purple book made by humans.
