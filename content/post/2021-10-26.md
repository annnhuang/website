最近在想，到底什麼叫做 "人生勝利組" ？i’ve been thinking recently: how do you define, or what do you define as success? what does success mean to you?

i don’t know where or how this chinese term originated, but it’s been plaguing me. the term is literally translated as “human life victory group”, which essentially means— “winners in life” (versus losers, like during a game— in a sarcastic, colloquial sense). in popular culture, this term is sometimes used to describe people who, e.g. are rich with a great career, happily married with three kids, etc.

currently, i think success to me means being honest with yourself, whilst finding your unique value, purpose and role in the society in order to (but not in a dutiful sense) make a positive contribution to it.

the term “winners in life” is jealousy in disguise. person a calls person b a “winner in life” because person a believes person b “has it all”.

(“belief is a beautiful armor, but makes for the heaviest sword” - john mayer)

well. i also used to think that grass is always greener on the other side. but this concept has been gradually shattered as i come in touch with people from various walks of life. i realized that every single person is battling their own demons.
