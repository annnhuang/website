going into my second year of phd, here’s what i think pursuing a phd means for me so far- 

it means you’re now really taking time rethinking and diving into the depths of those equations you learned (and sometimes hated) during high school...

the most rewarding part of it all is that you start to gain some genuine understanding about what it is that you are studying and its relation to the naturalistic world.

additionally, in my masters or bachelors i might get away with the little things (this *might* mean that, or *plug and chug*, BOOM, done) , but this is not the case during the course of a phd.

a phd training really trains my character to be thorough, detailed-oriented and critically think through things again and again, step by step.

working together with my pi for a phd also trains me to be concise, systematic, and simple in my thinking. science is simple, it is not complicated. you don’t need complicated methods or black-boxy algorithms sometimes, all you need is a good question and a suitable tool you need to answer the question.

i realized that my success is not determined by my own effort, but supported by many others - your colleagues, your boss, those that supported you in your masters, friends, family (it really does take a village to train a phd, and a whole lot of luck and opportunities).
